# Greedy_Clustering_Algorithm
Task Description: Cluster 7 medical images (representing normal and tumor cells) into two categories using a greedy clustering algorithm based on Kruskalâ€™s MST approach. Given a similarity distance matrix, implement an efficient O(n log n) algorithm that utilizes the Union-Find data structure to merge clusters.
